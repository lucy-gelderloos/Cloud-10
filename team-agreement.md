TJ - Taking good notes, and not being too stubborn to ask for help.

Erin - Clear orginazation.


We will meet first thing in the mornings (9am) and map out what we will accomplish that day, and review what we completed the day before.
We will implement a daily check-in at 1PM PT / 4PM ET. If not in Remo, make sure to check slack at least once an hour.

## Conflict Plan:

We will communicate with each other if there is a conflict. We state during our first meeting that if anyone feels as though one person is overbearing or not pulling their weight, we will kindly discuss it. We will keep everyones best intentions, as we never know what someone is going through.

If our attemps at conflict resolution are unsuccesful we cwill bring it up to the instructural team.

## Communication Plan:

We will be available to communicate 8:30 AM PT - 10:00 PM PT to communicate.

We use Slack, Trello, phone numbers if needed.

We understand that if someone does not reply to a request on Slack and it has been hours, the communicator can go ahead with the action.

If we fall behind, we will meet up and take time to work as a group.

We will communicate via Slack after hours and on the weekend.

We will use our fairness and judgement and make sure everyones voice is heard. We will support each other so we each feel comfortable to speak up.

We discussed in our first meeting that this is a safe space for all of us to be ourselves and speak up as needed.

## Work Plan:

Once we determine our project, we will create a wireframe and split up the sections evenly.

We will try Trello out on Monday.

## Git Process:

At 9AM every morning we will complete all the merges that we need to accomplish.

We will all have access and will view the Repo.

We will be very clear on who has what file open at what time.
